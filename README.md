# The Anatomy of a Branch Site Audit

A lightning talk to introduce the standard processes and techniques used when conducting an audit of a typical branch office's technical environment. The content is intended to be practical, discussing different approaches and considerations of scope before covering specific methods.

The intended audience is early professional level (beginner to intermediate) and does not require an extensive technical background.

Attendees are encouraged to interrupt either session and ask questions.
